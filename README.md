Diabetes Prediction

Problem Overview:
This project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures provided in the PIMA dataset. The following algorithms are used:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. K-Nearest Neighbor
4. Random Forest
5. Naive Bayes Classifier
6. Gradient Boost Classifier

Dataset:
The PIMA dataset contains diagnostic measurements for 768 female patients, including pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The outcome variable indicates whether the patient developed diabetes within five years of the measurements.

Requirements:
This project requires the following libraries:
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* Seaborn

Steps - Run diabetes_pred.py in the pythin terminal
